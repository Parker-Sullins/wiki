#Verilog
Verilog, standardized as ieee 1364, is a hardware description language (hdl) used to model electronic systems. it is most commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction. it is also used in the verification of analog circuits and mixed-signal circuits, as well as in the design of genetic circuits. in 2009, the verilog standard(ieee 1364-2005) was merged into the systemverilog standard, creating ieee standard 1800-2009. since then, verilog is officially part of the systemverilog language. the current version is ieee standard 1800-2017.
